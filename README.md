# News App

A modern Android News Application developed as part of my learning journey in Android development.
The app delivers the latest news in a clean, fast, and user-friendly interface with smooth navigation and theme customization.

## About the Project

News App allows users to explore news articles from different categories, search for specific topics, and save articles for later reading.
It focuses on providing a seamless reading experience while following modern Android development practices.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, API integration, Firebase authentication, and UI/UX design.
